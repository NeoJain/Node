Import required modules − We use the require directive to load Node.js modules.
Create server − A server which will listen to client's requests similar to Apache HTTP Server.
Read request and return response − The server created in an earlier step will read the HTTP request made by the client which can be a browser or a console and return the response.

Now execute the main.js to start the server as follows −
$ node main.js
Verify the Output. Server has started.
